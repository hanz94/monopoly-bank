# Monopoly Bank

Monopoly Bank (fullstack React-based application) is a modern digital banking system designed for players of the classic board version of Monopoly. The app replaces physical cash with a fully electronic, real-time banking experience, ideal for players sitting together and managing in-game finances more efficiently.
