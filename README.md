# Monopoly Bank

Monopoly Bank (fullstack React-based application) is a modern digital banking system designed for players of the classic board version of Monopoly. The app replaces physical cash with a fully electronic, real-time banking experience, ideal for players sitting together and managing in-game finances more efficiently.

# Features
With Monopoly Bank you can:

âž¡ Create games for 2â€“6 players with custom settings (start bonus, initial balance, currency: PLN, EUR, USD),

âž¡ Switch between Player and Bank tabs depending on your role,

âž¡ Send and receive money transfers between players,

âž¡ Request transfers from other players, with built-in notification support,

âž¡ Claim bonuses, pay taxes, or withdraw bank bonuses, just like in the physical game,

âž¡ Track all account balances in real time (thanks to Firebase Realtime Database),

âž¡ Allow other players to join a game via Game ID and individual player code, provided by the game owner,

âž¡ Manage permissions: Only the game creator has initial access to the Bank tab, but can extend this privilege to others.
